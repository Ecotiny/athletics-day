# Athletics Day Score Tracking Software

This software allows a school or similar institution to create a fast, easily accessible digital record of the results of events that occur at an event such as an athletics day. The data can be entered from mobile devices, as the website developed is (mostly) mobile friendly.

 - Database (SQLite3)
 - API (Node.js)
 - Data entry website (HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap)
