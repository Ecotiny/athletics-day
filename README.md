# Athletics Day Score Tracking Software

This software allows a school or similar institution to create a fast, easily accessible digital record of the results of events that occur at an event such as an athletics day. The data can be entered from mobile devices, as the website developed is (mostly) mobile friendly.

There are 3 main components of the software. They are:
 - The database (SQLite3)
 - The API (Node.js)
 - The data entry website (HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap)
 - The admin website (HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap)
